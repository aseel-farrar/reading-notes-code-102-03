***
what I leaned:
1. Some of Command Line commands:
    * pwd: stands for Print Working Directory, and It tells you what your current or present working directory is.

    * Ls: It listed the contents of our current directory

    * ls -l: indicates we are going to do a long listing

    * ls /etc: it tells ls not to list our current directory but instead to list that directories contents

    * ls -l /etc: it did a long listing of the directory /etc

    * cd: Change Directories

    * ls -a: List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
